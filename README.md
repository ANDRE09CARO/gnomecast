GnomeCast
=========

This is a native Linux GUI for casting local files to ChromeCast devices.  It supports:

- Realtime transcoding (only when needed)
- Subtitles (embedded and external SRT files)
- Fast scrubbing (waiting 20s for buffering to skip 30s ahead is wrong!)

Install
-------
Please run:

```
pip3 install gnomecast
```

Please report bugs!
